- TODO: create {variable}_page_fig and {variable}_transcription_method for variables where related_variables = True. Set for transcription methods: "set": ["table", "figure", "spreadsheet"].
- follow PEP 8 / pylint
- Add second argument to assert to give more context about why the assertion exists.
- Check that LaTeX in the JSON file is properly escaped.
- Add docstrings.
- Add covariance column. Constraint: <https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3830254>
- Recognize boolean variables even though they are stored as integers in the database. Convert them to booleans when reading.
- Add tests for add_percent_uncertainty and add_absolute_uncertainty where the ndarray has nans.
- Try to load faulty data (out of bounds, etc.) to check if the assertions, database constraints, etc., work.
- Test that the database is as expected after loading the test data.
- Add new column to the database for the file that the data originally came from.
- Have a function to more easily check if certain numbers are identical. E.g., use to check consistency with redundant data.
- Have a log file for things that are unusual but not fatal.
- Output the most extreme value in each variable (large and small) to the log file. This will help you find data points with errors.
- Have standard functions to perform regression including uncertainties. Functions for power law, single coefficient, linear.
    - Linear regression taking into account data uncertainty:
        - <https://github.com/rsnemmen/BCES> (simplest choice, in pip)
        - <https://github.com/jmeyers314/linmix>
        - <https://github.com/Gabriel-p/photpy/issues/10>
- Calculate AIC.
- Pylint
- <https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/05/reuse-your-data.html>
- output stored in a single file with revision number, whether code was modified
- Write Python wrapper functions to INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT data with uncertainties and units from a Sqlite database
