- Function to update Sqlite database with mean and standard deviation that checks that the units are as expected.
- Mandatory uncertainty column
- schema table listing units of each column, TeX code for variable, text description of each ==> read in from a CSV file before creating database?
- Schema CSV file also has optional database constraint information: lower bound, upper bound
- <https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/05/reuse-your-data.html>
- output stored in a single file with revision number, whether code was modified
- Use sets of fake data for testing purposes.
- track whether uncertainty was estimated for a particular data point
- Write Python wrapper functions to INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT data with uncertainties and units from a Sqlite database
